This tool allows to import data from some running watches.

It creates GPX and Fitlog files that should be usable with any software supporting GPX or Fitlog file formats.

The GPX files produced have been tested in:
  * [pytrainer](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/pytrainer)
  * [SportsTracker](http://www.saring.de/sportstracker)
  * [Turtle Sport](http://turtlesport.sourceforge.net)
  * [Endomondo](http://www.endomondo.com/home)
  * [Runkeeper](http://runkeeper.com/home)

**Main functionalities are:**
  * import data from watch or from GPX files
  * export data to GPX, Fitlog, KML, HTML, JPG ...
  * automatically fix elevation information using Google Elevation API
  * upload route from your computer to the watch
  * replay your session in 3D in Google Earth
  * support for Linux and Windows

You have another device and would like to have it supported ? If you are ready to spend some time to provide me samples of USB dumps from imports done on windows, please contact me (if you don't know how to do the dumps, I'll explain you).
